# Project Name: Book Recommendation System

## Project Description:
This project implements two types of book recommendation systems: popularity-based and collaborative filtering-based. The popularity-based recommender suggests popular books based on the number of ratings and average ratings received from users. The collaborative filtering-based recommender recommends books similar to the one provided as input, based on user-item interactions.

## Installation:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have the required dataset files "Books.csv", "Users.csv", and "Ratings.csv" in the project directory.
2. Run the provided Python code to load and preprocess the dataset.
3. The code contains two types of book recommendation systems:
   - Popularity-Based Recommender: It suggests popular books based on the number of ratings and average ratings.
   - Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender: It recommends books similar to the one provided as input, based on user-item interactions.
4. You can call the recommend() function with the name of the book you want recommendations for in the collaborative filtering-based recommender.

## Configuration:
There is no specific configuration required for this project. However, you can experiment with different datasets or fine-tune the collaborative filtering algorithm for better recommendations.
